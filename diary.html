                        <h3>The Eldest Daughter</h3>
                        <p>People always said to me, “Lucky you for being the first child, you get anything you want,” but I’ve never really felt that way; 
                            maybe it looks true to them, but not to me. The eldest child, the runaway daughter, the villain, the selfish one, the angry woman, 
                            the one who’s “too mature,” “too much,” “too independent,” the one they never worry about because “she’ll figure it out,” 
                            the backbone even when her own spine is tired. They don’t see that she’s the same girl who only ever wanted to be loved safely, 
                            to rest without guilt, to be understood without explaining her pain again and again — the girl who learned to swallow everything silently 
                            because everyone else needed her to be okay. She protects herself because no one else ever did, she comforts others while her own heart 
                            stays untouched. Being the eldest daughter is not for the weak; it means growing up too fast, learning alone, carrying expectations 
                            she never agreed to, becoming the emotional shock absorber, the unpaid therapist, the invisible support system. And still she shows up, 
                            still loves, still forgives, still tries, still carries everyone even when no one notices she’s breaking — because that’s what the eldest 
                            daughter does: she survives, even when she shouldn’t have to.</p>

                        <h3>Alone or Lonely?</h3>
                        <p>There’s a quiet, persistent assumption in our hyper-connected world that being alone is synonymous with being lonely, that a solitary figure is a 
                            hollow space to be pitied and filled. Loneliness is a chilling emptiness that can haunt you in the middle of a crowded room, a gnawing feeling of being invisible, 
                            misunderstood, and profoundly disconnected even when surrounded by the noise and chatter of others; it is a state of lack, a longing for a connection that feels 
                            just out of reach. In stark contrast, being alone is a chosen sanctuary, a deliberate and peaceful solitude where you can finally hear the sound of your own thoughts, 
                            recharge a spirit weary from constant performance, and breathe deeply without the suffocating weight of anyone else's expectations or judgments. It is in this quiet space that 
                            we often find our deepest strengths and most honest voices, learning that we can be our own most comforting company. So, no, solitude is not a punishment 
                            or a void; it is not about a lack of company, but about the rich, fulfilling presence of self—a sacred space where you are both the anchor and the ocean, 
                            completely whole and resilient even in the profound and beautiful quiet.</p>

                        <h3>What Makes Me Happy?</h3>
                        <p>My happiness is a quiet song woven from simple, sacred joys: the deep comfort of a favorite meal, the childish bliss of melting ice cream, the gentle whisper 
                            of the color pink, and the friendly smile of My Melody. It lives in the grace of noticing—a sunset, a kind glance—and in the hard-won peace of loving who I am. 
                            It swells when met by the warmth of others' kindness, a gentle reminder that we are all connected in our search for softness. But above all, this fragile joy 
                            is cradled by one unshakable truth: the constant, merciful presence of Allah by my side. His nearness is the thread that ties my world together, transforming 
                            simple pleasures into conscious blessings and every hardship into a test faced with borrowed strength. Every solitary joy is multiplied, 
                            and every silent fear is halved, weaving my scattered moments into a tapestry of resilient and grateful contentment. It's the profound peace of morning prayers that 
                            colors my day with hope, the strength found in trusting a plan greater than my own. This happiness isn't loud or demanding - it's the soft light that fills ordinary moments, 
                            making even the simplest breath feel like a gift, and turning daily life into a continuous conversation with grace.</p>

                        <h3>Me V.S Me</h3>
                        <p>The greatest battle I ever fight is Me versus Me—a silent war waged in the quiet corners of my mind, where my most ambitious dreams are besieged by my deepest 
                            insecurities. One version of me stands as my own relentless architect, building towers of future triumph, mapping out paths of discipline and growth, whispering 
                            of potential and purpose, believing fiercely in all that I could become. Yet the other me remains the saboteur, the keeper of every past failure and future fear, 
                            armed with doubts that echo in the dark—reminding me of stumbles, whispering that I am not enough, wrapping me in the comfortable chains of familiarity. 
                            I am both the warrior and the wound, the motivator and the critic, the hand that reaches for the stars and the anchor that holds me fast to the harbor of my 
                            hesitations. Some days, the believer wins—I rise, I create, I move mountains that only I can see. Other days, the doubter dominates, and I retreat into the safety 
                            of smallness, nursing the bruises from my own thoughts. But this is not a battle for destruction; it is a dance for definition. With every choice, every forgiven 
                            mistake, every morning I begin again, I am sculpting the self I choose to be. I am learning to lead with compassion, to quiet the critic with kindness, and to 
                            recognize that both these versions of me are essential—one to push, one to protect. And in the tension between them, I am not breaking; I am being built. I am both 
                            the conflict and the resolution, and this lifelong confrontation is where my strength is forged.</p>

                        <h3>Insecure</h3>
                        <p>Insecure is the quiet tremor in my voice when I say "I'm fine," the invisible weight that settles on my chest in a room full of laughing people. 
                            It's the constant, humming fear that I am one misstep away from being found out, from someone discovering that I don't truly belong here, that my 
                            accomplishments are flukes and my confidence is a carefully constructed facade. It lives in the endless comparison—scrolling through a highlight reel 
                            of other lives, other bodies, other successes, while I'm left picking apart my own reflection in the mirror, cataloging every flaw and imagined failure. 
                            It's the second-guessing of every text message sent, the replaying of conversations long ended, searching for hidden meanings and criticisms that probably 
                            were never there. It makes me desperately wanting connection but terrified of letting anyone see the real, uncurated mess inside. It is the exhausting work 
                            of performing a version of myself that feels acceptable, while beneath the surface, a younger, softer version of me is always whispering, "Are you sure you're 
                            good enough?" It is a battle fought in silence, a war waged within the confines of my own mind, where I am both the wounded and the one holding the knife. 
                            It's giving compliments freely while struggling to accept a single one in return, as if kindness toward myself must be earned through some impossible perfection. 
                            And in my quietest moments, it's the haunting question that remains: if I stopped fighting so hard to be enough for everyone else, would I ever be enough for me?</p>

                        <h3>Life's Cruelty</h3>
                        <p>Life's cruel not in its dramatic tragedies, but in its quiet, consistent betrayals. It's the way it gives you dreams too big for your reality, 
                            then mocks you for ever reaching in the first place. It's building a foundation of trust with someone, brick by careful brick, only to watch them use 
                            those same bricks to build a wall against you. It's the relentless hope that things will get better, dangled just out of reach like a mirage that 
                            shimmers and vanishes the moment you get close. Life is working tirelessly for a goal, sacrificing sleep and sanity, and then watching someone else 
                            stumble into the very thing you bled for. It's the cruel irony of time—giving you wisdom only after the moments you needed it most have passed, 
                            leaving you with the haunting clarity of "what if." It's loving people with your entire being, only to learn that your entire being wasn't enough to 
                            make them stay. It's the universe's indifference to your suffering, the sun rising just as beautifully on your worst day as it did on your best, a 
                            stark reminder that the world does not pause for your pain. It's the way nostalgia sweetens memories you can never return to, turning your own past 
                            into a country you're permanently exiled from. It's giving your last ounce of strength to someone, only to find yourself empty when your own crisis 
                            comes. Life is a beautiful, brutal teacher that gives you the test first and the lesson later, often long after the grade has been etched in permanent 
                            ink. And perhaps its greatest cruelty is that it forces you to be strong, not by giving you strength, but by leaving you with no other choice.</p>
